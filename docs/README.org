might not work for one person could be highly effective for another
due to individual biological variations.

*** Cupping (Hijima)
Cupping Cupping, also known as Hijama in Arabic, is an ancient healing
technique that has been used for centuries to treat various health
problems. It involves using small glass cups to create a vacuum on the
skin, which draws out toxins and promotes healing.

The practice of Hijama involves creating a vacuum on specific points
of the skin using 9-11 plastic cups on either side of the spine, neck,
and shoulder blades. Cuts are made to the skin under the cups, and the
cups are suctioned to create a vacuum, which pulls out the blood and
other fluids from the skin, removing toxins and promoting healing.

Hijama therapy has historical roots in ancient Egyptian and Chinese
medical practices, and it has been documented in various civilizations
throughout history.

It is also mentioned in Islamic traditions, with hadiths supporting
its recommendation and use by the Islamic prophet Muhammad.

Despite its long history, there is limited evidence to support its
effectiveness as a treatment method, with most studies indicating that
there is no high-quality evidence for its use except for treating
pain. While some traditional perspectives suggest that Hijama therapy
can balance the body's humours, improve blood circulation, and
strengthen the immune system, modern research indicates that it may
stimulate the body's natural healing response.

However, there is no conclusive evidence supporting the claimed health
benefits of cupping, and critics have characterized the practice as
pseudoscience.

Cupping therapy is generally considered safe for most people, but it
can cause bruising and may lead to skin infections.
