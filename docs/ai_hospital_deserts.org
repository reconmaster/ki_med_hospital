* Hospital Deserts in MKE
#+begin_ai
[SYS]: Please help me write python code using matlab showing hospital
deserts in Milwaukee.

[AI]: To visualize hospital deserts in Milwaukee using Python with data possibly from MATLAB, we will follow a set of steps. We'll assume you have access to hospital locations data and city boundary shape data for Milwaukee. Below is a Python code snippet that uses the `geopandas` and `matplotlib` libraries for the visualization.

### Step-by-Step Code Example

1. **Install Required Libraries**: You need to install the necessary libraries if you haven't already. You can do this using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install geopandas matplotlib
   ```

2. **Prepare Your Data**:
   Ensure you have two datasets:
   - A GeoJSON or shapefile of Milwaukee's boundaries.
   - A GeoJSON or CSV file containing the locations of hospitals in Milwaukee.

3. **Example Code**:

Here's a sample code to visualize hospital deserts in Milwaukee:

```python
import geopandas as gpd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load Milwaukee boundaries
milwaukee_boundaries = gpd.read_file('path_to_milwaukee_boundaries.shp')

# Load Hospital locations
hospital_data = gpd.read_file('path_to_hospital_locations.geojson')  # Ensure your file's format is correct

# Create a base map
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 10))
milwaukee_boundaries.plot(ax=ax, color='lightgrey', edgecolor='black')

# Plot hospitals
hospital_data.plot(ax=ax, color='red', markersize=30, label='Hospitals')

# Optionally, you can create a hexbin or density plot to show areas with fewer hospitals
hospital_density = hospital_data.geometry.unary_union.buffer(0.001).envelope  # Adjust buffer as necessary

ax.set_title('Hospital Locations in Milwaukee', fontsize=15)
plt.xlabel('Longitude')
plt.ylabel('Latitude')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Save the plot if desired
plt.savefig('milwaukee_hospital_deserts.png')
```

### Explanation

- **GeoPandas** is used to read geospatial data.
- **Matplotlib** is used for plotting the locations.
- The script reads in the Milwaukee boundaries and hospital locations, then generates a map plotted with the boundaries in light grey and hospitals in red.
- The commented-out portion indicates how you might visualize density or coverage gaps if needed, depending on how you define "hospital deserts."

### Next Steps

- **Check your datasets' paths and formats.** Ensure they are correct.
- **Define "hospital deserts":** You may want to analyze coverage areas based on population density or specific geographic areas.
- **Visual adjustments**: You might want to customize marker sizes, colors, or the plot's appearance as necessary.

This code serves as a foundational step to visualize hospital deserts. You should adapt it to your specific requirements and datasets.
